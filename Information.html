			<h3>Butterfly life cycle</h3> 
			<p>The butterfly life cycle consists of four different life stages: egg, caterpillar, pupa and adult or imago.<br/>
			The differences between those life stages are incredible! Butterflies in their adult stage can live from a week to nearly a year depending on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters.<br/>
			Butterflies may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.</p><hr/>

			<p>All butterflies are oviparous. Depending on the species, butterflies can lay a few hundred to many thousands eggs. The shapes of the eggs vary widely. The surface of the egg can be smooth or it can have pits and grooves. A female butterfly mostly lays her eggs on leaves or twigs. Depending on the temperature, the embryo develops in 1-3 weeks to a caterpillar. The colour of the egg becomes darker as it matures.</p>
			<p>Butterfly eggs are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, deforming the shape of the egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue is unknown and is a suitable subject for research. The same glue is produced by a pupa to secure the setae of the cremaster. This glue is so hard that the silk pad, to which the setae are glued, cannot be separated.</p>
			<p>Butterfly eggs are protected by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; the purpose of these holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly and moth eggs vary greatly in size between species, but they are all either spherical or ovate

			<div id="center1"><img width="30%" height="20%" src="Butterfly Photo/caterpiller.jpg" alt="caterpiller" /></div>
			<p>As soon as the embryo has developed into a caterpillar, it eats his way out of the egg. While the caterpillars pass from the egg stage to the pupal stage, they typically shed their skin and molt several times.</p>
			<p>Caterpillars mature through a series of stages called instars. Near the end of each instar, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, in which the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle beneath. At the end of each instar, the larva moults the old cuticle, and the new cuticle expands, before rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.</p>
			<p>Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs from the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that help them grip the substrate.</p>
			<p>Some caterpillars have the ability to inflate parts of their head to appear snake-like. Many have false eye-spots to enhance this effect. Some caterpillars have special structures called osmeteria which are everted to produce foul-smelling chemicals. These are used in defense.

			<div id="center2"><img width="30%" height="20%" src="Butterfly Photo/pilla.jpg" alt="pilla" /></div>
			<p>During the caterpillar stage, butterflies can travel long distances in search of an ideal place to pupate. The insect undergoes lots of changes during this stage. Although on the outside, there is almost no physical activity.</p> 
			<p>The pupal transformation into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings visible on the outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients.</p>
			<p>If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size.</p>
			<p>Several boundaries seen in the adult color pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa

			Butterfly life cycle stage 4: Adult</a></h1></div>
			<div id="st"><img width="30%" height="20%" src="Butterfly Photo/adult.jpg" alt="adult" /></div>
			<p>The adult, sexually mature, stage of the insect is known as the imago. As Lepidoptera, butterflies have four wings that are covered with tiny scales (see photo). The fore and hindwings are not hooked together, permitting a more graceful flight.</p>
			<p>An adult butterfly has six legs, but in the nymphalids, the first pair is reduced. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded.</p>
			<p>A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and let them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators. Some butterflies' wings may take up to three hours to dry while others take about one hour.</p>
			<p>Most butterflies and moths will excrete excess dye after hatching. This fluid may be white, red, orange, or in rare cases, blue

			<div id="pt"><img width="30%" height="20%" src="Butterfly Photo/habit.jpg" alt="habit" /></div>
			<p>Here are the most spectacular butterfly facts for kids including butterfly habitat, diet, and reproduction.</p> 
			<p>Fundamentally speaking, a butterfly is a day-flying insect belongs to the Lepidoptera order. There are four parts of the butterfly’s lifecycle namely; egg, larva, pupa and adult.</p>
			<p>Nearly all species are diurnal. They have brilliantly colored wings. Butterflies consist of skippers, the true butterflies, and moth-butterflies. The rest of the families lying within Lepidoptera are termed as moths.</p> 
			<p>The earliest butterfly fossils date back to the Eocene era, between 40 – 50 million years ago. These types of insects show polymorphism, mimicry and aposematism. There are some species that travel great distances. Monarch butterfly is one of them.</p>
			<p>Few species are thought to have been evolved symbiotic and sponging relationships. There are some that are considered as pests since they tend to damage domestic crops and trees in their larva stage.</p>
			<p>On the contrary, some species become the reason for plants pollination as they eat harmful insects. These butterflies are referred to as Harvesters. Culturally, butterfly has gathered a huge attention in the field of visual and literary arts</p>
			<p>Butterflies feed primarily on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen,[26] tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants, although, in general, they do not carry as much pollen load as bees. They are, however, capable of moving pollen over greater distances.[27] Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.</p>

			<p>Adult butterflies consume only liquids, ingested through the proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, from which they obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction.</p>
			<p>Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. </p>
			<p>Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and studies have suggested that the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift along with the spermatophore, during mating.
